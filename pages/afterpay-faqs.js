			question: "Are there extra fees when I use Afterpay?",

						<h2 className="font-jost text-3xl font-semibold mt-5 text-[#74dfbd]">What is Afterpay?</h2>
						<p>Buy-now, pay-later financing allows shoppers to make purchases and pay them off over time. Afterpay, which is now owned by payments technology company Block, is an Australian company that offers such consumer loans free of interest.
						</p>
						<p>Launched in 2015, the Afterpay platform now serves customers in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada. Additionally, it is available in the United Kingdom, France, and Spain, where it is known as Clearpay.</p>
						<h2 className="font-jost text-3xl font-semibold mt-5 text-[#74dfbd]">Features Of Afterpay</h2>
						<p><b>No interest: -</b> Working in a way similar to a no-interest loan, the only charges a customer will pay are their instalments every 2 weeks, and any applicable late fees.</p>
						<p><b>No advance sign-up for in-store purchases: -</b> Even if you don't have an account, you can still walk into a selected retailer and choose Afterpay. You'll just need to sign up later.</p>
						<p><b>Manage your account: -</b> Sign in to see your upcoming payments, orders and account information.</p>
						<p><b>Reminders: -</b> You'll be notified ahead of time when a payment is coming up and how much it is, so that you can make sure there's no overdrawing.</p>
						<p><b>Automatic deductions: -</b> Each quarter amount is automatically deducted from your chosen card to make sure you can keep up with your repayments, even if you're busy or you can't get online.</p>
						<p><b>Refunds and more: -</b> You can still get a refund for purchases you've made with Afterpay, in line with each store's refunds policy.</p>
						<p><b>Pay in advance: -</b> You can pay instalments ahead of time, penalty-free.</p>
						<p><b>Market-leading security: -</b> Afterpay is a PCI DSS Level 1 certified compliant Service Provider organisation. This is the highest level of payment security there is, for both your card details and your personal information.</p>
						<p><b>Earn rewards: -</b> Shopping through Afterpay and paying each of your instalments on time can earn you benefits through Afterpay's Pulse Rewards program. These rewards range from discounts at stores to being able to postpone your upfront quarter payment from checkout to 2 weeks after your purchase.</p>
